- `knowledge/design-principles.md`: DP-011 (Business Outcome First), DP-012 (Skill Granularity in Governance)

### Architecture (EA/SA/DA percolation)
- `architecture/reference/domain-model.md`: Skill entity, SubscriptionBillingEvent entity
- `architecture/reference/components/business-platform.md`: Skill Manager, Performance Monitor, Subscription Manager components
- `architecture/reference/components/ai-runtime.md`: Conversational Configuration Engine component
- `architecture/reference/api-specs/business-platform.openapi.yaml`: Skills, Performance, Billing, Conversational Config endpoints + schemas

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-08

### Constitutional (Founder Resolutions)
- FR-002: Trial = full constitutional employment from day one; trial outputs owned by customer
- FR-003: Agent learning is WAOOAW institutional IP; customer data is private and never shared
- FR-004: Agent Teams — enterprise tier, WAOOAW-provided Team Coordinator, deferred from MVI

### Architecture (gaps bridged by simulation)
- `architecture/reference/domain-model.md`: EmploymentContract `isTrial`, `trialEndsAt`, `trialConvertedAt`
- `infrastructure/postgres/init/03-enums-and-tables.sql`: trial columns on `business.employment_contracts`
- `architecture/reference/api-specs/business-platform.openapi.yaml`: trial fields + `POST /convert-trial` endpoint
- `architecture/reference/data/ledger-design.md`: Institutional Learning Zone (FR-003 fourth data zone)
- `architecture/reference/security/security-architecture.md`: Data Classification table §0 (FR-003)

### Backlog
- IB-018: Agent Teams — Constitutional Team Architecture (enterprise, post-MVI, DEFERRED)
