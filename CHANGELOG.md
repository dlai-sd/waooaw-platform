## [0.10.1] — 2026-07-08

### Fix (gate violation correction)
- **OD-008 CRITICAL**: Removed premature IB-009 implementation code from `src/`
  - `src/constitutional-engine/`, `src/business-platform/`, `src/professional-runtime/`, `src/ai-runtime/` — all removed
  - `tests/constitutional/bp/test_cct_ef_01.py` — removed (premature)
  - Code was constitutionally correct in content but produced without Founder authorization
  - Implementation requires explicit Founder authorization per session — G5 CLEAR is not authorization

### Constitutional (gate enforcement)
- `constitution/BOOTSTRAP.md`: IMPLEMENTATION GATE hard stop added
  - G5 CLEAR = prerequisites met, NOT authorization to write code
  - Any action creating files in src/ requires explicit Founder confirmation
- `constitution/AGENT-ENTRY.md`: Implementation gate at the very top — visible every session
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: IMPLEMENTATION GATE section added as ABSOLUTE rule
- `work-contracts/operational-discoveries.md`: OD-008 violation recorded with root causes

### Documentation
- `README.md`: Version 0.10.1, G5 wording corrected to "prerequisites met — awaiting Founder authorization"

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-08 (VIOLATION — premature implementation, corrected by 0.10.1)

The v0.10.0 implementation artifacts (src/) were produced without explicit Founder authorization.
They are preserved in git history for institutional transparency but removed from working tree.
See OD-008 in work-contracts/operational-discoveries.md for full analysis.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-08
