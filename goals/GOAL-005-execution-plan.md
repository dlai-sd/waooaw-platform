| Status | PROVISIONAL — R2-03 CA Readiness Review and Registrant acknowledgement pending |

## Outcome and Boundary

Coordinate D-01 through D-07 to approve shared Agent Employment foundations and produce implementation-ready AE-01 Work Contract candidates. AE-01 remains generic and is proven first by a simulation of a WhatsApp-first DMA trial-to-hire journey. AE-02 through AE-06 remain at their confirmed skeleton depth. The plan stops before implementation.

## Execution Sequence

| Phase | Deliverable | Dependency | Participating Institutions | Gate to next phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | D-01 Employment Capability Confirmation | R2-03 plan approval and acknowledgement | INST-003 primary; INST-011 product-outcome input | Business capabilities, actors, vocabulary, and AE-01 outcome boundaries approved |
| 2 | D-03 Identity and Employment State Model | D-01 accepted | INST-004 primary; INST-006 data contribution | Participant identifiers, aggregate, state transitions, idempotency, and evidence correlation approved |
| 3 | D-02 AEEC Foundation v1.0 | D-01 and D-03 accepted | INST-004 primary; INST-002 constitutional contribution | Normative clauses and constitutional review approved |
| 4 | D-04 Omnichannel Continuity Contract | D-02 and D-03 accepted | INST-004 primary; INST-007 security contribution; INST-005 solution-contract contribution | WhatsApp/web/mobile handoff, state ownership, degradation, and conformance rules approved |
| 5 | D-05 Shared Gap Closure Plan | D-01 through D-04 accepted | INST-011 primary; INST-004 architecture review | Every foundation gap has sequence, owner, acceptance evidence, and epic gate |
| 6 | D-06 AE-01 Release Grooming and Simulation | D-01 through D-05 accepted | INST-011 primary; INST-003 outcome review; INST-004 architecture review; INST-005 contract review; INST-006 data review; INST-007 security review | Simulation passes; proposed AE-01 Work Contracts meet WC-038 through WC-040 quality; no foundation gap remains open |
| 7 | D-07 Independent Validation and Ratification | D-06 accepted | INST-001 final independent validator and ratifier; INST-002 evidence-package preparation only | Founder ratification decision and separate implementation boundary recorded |

Sujay's DMA workshop is required input to D-06 simulation and grooming. Because Sujay is a domain authority rather than a registered Institution, the workshop evidence is incorporated and attested by INST-011; it is not represented as an independent GO-authorized Contribution Record.

## Per-Institution Evidence Specifications

| Institution | Required contribution records | Minimum content | Participation Window | Independence constraint |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INST-003 Business Architect | D-01 Capability Confirmation; D-06 Outcome Review | Generic capabilities, actors, personas, vocabulary, measurable AE-01 outcomes, DMA boundary | D-01: 2 constitutional sessions; D-06 review: 1 session after package delivery | May not approve architecture or perform final validation |
| INST-011 Product Owner | D-01 Product Outcome Input; D-05 Gap Closure Plan; D-06 Release Grooming Package | Release boundary, gap priority, closure evidence, simulation acceptance, proposed WC set and dependencies | D-01: 1 session; D-05: 2 sessions; D-06: 3 sessions | May not invent architecture or authorize implementation |
| INST-004 Enterprise Architect | D-03 State Model architecture; D-02 AEEC; D-04 Continuity architecture; D-05/D-06 reviews | Shared invariants, normative contracts, cross-wave boundaries, required ADR decisions, architecture conformance | 3 sessions per primary contribution; 1 session per review | May not prioritize stories or perform final validation |
| INST-006 Data Architect | D-03 Data Contribution; D-06 Data Review | Durable identifiers, aggregate and state semantics, idempotency, evidence correlation, continuity data impacts | D-03: 2 sessions; D-06 review: 1 session | Must not validate its own D-03 evidence |
| INST-002 Constitutional Analyst | D-02 Constitutional Review; D-07 evidence-package preparation | Rights, consent, Human Override, evidence rules, constitutional traceability, unresolved-risk statement | D-02: 1 session; D-07 package: 1 session | Because INST-002 contributes, INST-001 performs final G-6/D-07 validation |
| INST-007 Security Architect | D-04 Security Contribution; D-06 Security Review | Authentication, participant verification, consent protection, channel handoff, tenant isolation, threats and controls | D-04: 2 sessions; D-06 review: 1 session | Must not validate its own D-04 evidence |
| INST-005 Solution Architect | D-04 Solution Contract; D-06 Contract Review | Component boundaries, APIs, events, failure/degradation contracts, conformance interfaces | D-04: 2 sessions; D-06 review: 1 session | Must consume approved architecture and may not alter it silently |
| INST-001 Founder | D-07 Final Validation and Ratification | Validate accumulated evidence, resolve any final constitutional decision, ratify or reject AEEC package, state implementation boundary | 1 constitutional session after D-07 package delivery | Independent final validator because INST-002 contributed earlier |

## Phased Authorization Rules

1. No GO Authorization is valid until this plan passes CA Readiness Review and the Registrant acknowledges it.
2. Phase 1 authorizations cover only D-01.
3. Each later phase is authorized only after the preceding gate's Contribution Records are accepted.
4. D-06 drafts may be prepared earlier as non-final working material, but no D-06 Contribution Record may be accepted before D-01 through D-05 close.
5. INST-010 receives no GO Authorization under this plan.
6. Any new Institution requires a Collaboration Amendment and updated Execution Plan.

## Readiness Checks Requested

- Institution status and Offering Scope match.
- Dependencies are acyclic and foundation-first.
- Evidence Specifications are complete and measurable.
- Participation Windows are explicit.
- INST-002 contribution and INST-001 final validation preserve G-02 independence.
- Simulation-first WhatsApp/DMA proof is mandatory before D-06 acceptance.
- No implementation authority is implied.
