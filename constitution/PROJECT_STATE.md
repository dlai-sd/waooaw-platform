## WORK MENU — Present this on /resume

**Founder indicated an important point to discuss. Present this menu and await the topic.**

**WAOOAW Engineering Organization — Session 2026-07-09 (next)**
**Version:** v0.26.0 | **Gate:** G5 prerequisites met | **3 agents fully approved + billed**

All three agents are approved, have billing specs, and are architecturally complete.
Two P1 gaps remain before Trading and Agricultural agents can go into an implementation sprint.

---

**Founder's Next Topic** — Awaiting Founder to introduce. Present the menu below and listen.

---

**Track A — Fix P1 gaps: Trading + Agricultural Section 4+5 gate compliance**

*Office: Business Architect (spec) → Enterprise Architect (gate verification)*

Trading v1.1 and Agricultural v2.0 fail Gate Sections 4 (Skill Runtime Config Standard) and 5 (Execution Loop). Per Section 16 of AGENT-AUTHORING-GUIDE, these are P1 items before their implementation sprints can begin. This sprint applies the Section 3.14 Skill Runtime Configuration Standard and heartbeat/session schedule declarations to both agents — same pattern as was done for DMA v2.0.

---

**Track B — New Agent specification**

*Office: Business Architect → Enterprise Architect → Founder*

Use `type:new-agent` issue template to trigger the flow for:
- Legal Professional — contract review, compliance advisory for India SMEs
- HR Professional — hiring, onboarding, performance management
- Accounting Professional — GST filing, TDS compliance, bookkeeping
- Real Estate Advisory — property search, legal due diligence

---

**Track C — IB-009 Foundation Implementation authorization**

*Requires explicit Founder "start coding" per session.*

All architecture prerequisites met. All 3 agents approved. Prompt library complete. All gaps resolved. The platform is implementation-ready for a first sprint on the Constitutional Engine skeleton. One sentence from the Founder unlocks it.

---

**Track D — Simulation runs for newer architectural components**

*Office: Business Architect + Constitutional Analyst*

No simulation covers: Synthetic Approval (C-044) activation flow, Platform Operations Agent (L1 health monitoring), or the AI Execution Loop (C-047). Running a simulation for any of these will surface constitutional gaps before implementation begins.

## Open Architectural Work (Non-Implementation) — Next Session Options

These are all valid pulls for the next session. No implementation gate applies to any of them.

---

## WORK MENU — Present this on /resume

> When the next session starts with `/resume`, read this section and present these options to the Founder verbatim. Do not re-derive from INSTITUTIONAL_BACKLOG.md — this menu is already filtered, gate-checked, and sequenced.

---

**WAOOAW Engineering Organization — Session 2026-07-09 (next)**
**Version:** v0.15.0 | **Gate:** G5 prerequisites met | **3 agents fully approved**

Digital Marketing Agent v2.0 approved with 14 skills, 3-phase bundles, and full architecture chain. Architecture is consistent across all layers. Founder indicated a next discussion point — present the menu below and await selection.

---

**Track A — Digital Marketing Agent simulation (new v2.0 skills)**

*Office: Business Architect (narrative) + Constitutional Analyst (claims extraction)*

The DMA v2.0 introduced Customer Profiling, Market Research, and the maturity score model. No simulation case exercises these new skills yet. Running a simulation of a new customer onboarding (Dr. Mehta or Sana) through the full v2.0 flow — registration → profiling conversation → market research → Maturity Report → Phase Bundle selection — would validate the constitutional constraints and potentially surface new claims (e.g., around the maturity scoring rubric, the AI-native interview interaction, or the budget enforcement chain). The same simulation process that produced C-042 from the agricultural agent design.

---

**Track B — New agent specification**

*Office: Business Architect (spec) → Enterprise Architect (review) → Founder (approval)*

Candidates the Founder mentioned or that are logically next for the Indian SME market:
- **Legal Professional** — contract review, compliance advisory for India SMEs
- **HR Professional** — hiring, onboarding, performance management for SMEs
- **Accounting Professional** — GST filing, TDS compliance, bookkeeping for India SMEs
- **Real Estate Advisory** — property search, legal due diligence for India buyers

Process: 13-section AGENT-AUTHORING-GUIDE + Architecture Chain Update (Section 11) + EA review + Founder approval + GENESIS amendment.

---

**Track C — Portal and CS agent architecture (IB-014 + IB-015)**

*Office: Business Architect + Solution Architect*

IB-014 (Domain 7 — Customer Self-Service Portal): 8 capabilities, 2 missing OpenAPI endpoints.
IB-015 (Domain 8 — Constitutional Customer Success Agents): CS agent specs (L1 + L2). First agent type where WAOOAW itself is the customer — interesting constitutional territory.

---

**Track D — Red Team + Confidence Register refresh**

*Office: Constitutional Analyst*

- C-043 (Financial Spend Cap) not yet in RED_TEAM.md — does it open attack surfaces?
- `knowledge/confidence-register.md` needs C-036–C-043 entries
- `knowledge/index.md` needs v0.14.x–v0.15.0 entries
- DMA v2.0: do the new MCP servers (meta-ads, google-ads, social-profile) open new attack vectors?

---

**Track E — Foundation Implementation (IB-009)**

*Requires explicit Founder "start coding" authorization for the session.*

G5 prerequisites met. All architecture approved. Implementation can begin when Founder authorizes. The first sprint would implement the Constitutional Engine skeleton + basic Professional Runtime + one acceptance scenario.

---
- A TO-DO list, a GitHub Issue, a Work Contract, a P0 label is NOT authorization
- Before any file in `src/`: STOP. Ask: "Do you authorize implementation for this session?"
- Code from v0.10.0 (commit dfbaf0b) can be restored with `git checkout dfbaf0b -- src/`

**Vocabulary Mandate (C-042) — design pattern established:**
- Any agent serving low-literacy customers: Vocabulary Translation Layer is mandatory (DP-013)
- Structural enforcement — not a prompt instruction
- AD-015: voice-primary interface for C-042 agents

**Architecture Chain Protocol (AGENT-AUTHORING-GUIDE Section 11):**
- Every new agent spec: 10 layers must be reviewed/updated alongside the spec
- Every agent update: targeted layer list by change type
- Every PR with agent changes: Architecture Chain Update table required in PR body
- Simulation runs validate correctness; the checklist prevents drift

**Constitutional design landmark (R-013 finding):**
- C-023 Evidence First → PMFBY insurance evidence chain: zero additional implementation effort
- First case of a constitutional compliance mechanism delivering direct customer financial benefit
- Pattern to apply to future agents: what other compliance mechanisms can become customer benefits?

**Three-tier RAG architecture (ADR-019):**
- Tier 1: Domain Knowledge (WAOOAW IP, shared per professional type)
- Tier 2: Customer Context (private per tenant, pgvector in business schema)
- Tier 3: Platform Intelligence (aggregate anonymized patterns, WAOOAW IP)
- Static data (ICAR, NBSS&LUP, etc.) = Tier 1 RAG, not MCP servers

**MCP Architecture (ADR-020, C-041):**
- AI Runtime is the MCP client
- CE.ValidateAction before every MCP tool call — enforced in AI Runtime, not MCP servers
- MCP servers are stateless adapters only: no business logic, no state
- 5 servers defined: weather-ensemble, agmarknet, whatsapp-voice, broker-api, whatsapp-business
- enam-mcp, policy-data-mcp: DEGRADABLE, deferred to Skills 3/5 implementation

### TO-DO LIST — Next Session

**P0 — Start the first development sprint:**

1. Create Sprint 1 GitHub Issue and assign to @copilot:
   - Template: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ib-implementation.yml`
   - Fill: IB-009, office:runtime-professional, sprint:1, gate:G5, component:all
   - Or invoke PO first: `@copilot You are Product Owner. Produce Sprint Plan for Sprint 1.`

2. IB-009 targets per service (first working code):
   - CE: /health (gRPC health) + RecordEvidence stub
   - BP: /health + POST /api/v1/employment/contracts + JWT middleware + EF Core baseline
   - PR: /health + Emergency Stop WebSocket
   - AI: /health + LLM inference stub
   - First CCT to pass: CCT-EF-01 (Evidence First)

**P1 — Parallel to IB-009:**

3. IB-014 API addenda (SA, 30 min): add /contracts/{id}/status + /professional-templates
4. IB-016 Platform Operations (PA): OTel metric names + P0 runbooks

**Founder one-time (GitHub UI, 10 min):**

5. Create GitHub Project "WAOOAW Platform Matrix" with views:
   Sprint Execution | Customer Readiness | NFR Coverage
   Labels are live — filter by component:* and domain:*

**Deferred (do not start without Founder decision):**

6. OD-003: DA scope boundary review (work-contracts/operational-discoveries.md)
7. AI Architect sprint (GAP-006b): LLM failover, UNCERTAIN PAAS path, token budget

---

### Efficiency: How the agent should start tomorrow

```
1. constitution/AGENT-ENTRY.md          ← routing + current state (200 lines)
2. adr/ADR-INDEX.md                     ← all 18 ADRs (18 lines)
3. .github/agent-context/office-{name}.md  ← charter (50 lines)
4. Work Contract + COMPONENT-QUICK-REF.md
```
This saves ~25,000 tokens before the first line of code.

## IN-PROGRESS CHECKPOINT

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| ADR-INDEX.md + AGENT-ENTRY.md | ✓ DONE |
| COMPONENT-QUICK-REF.md | ✓ DONE |
| Office Quick-Start cards (.github/agent-context/) | ✓ DONE |
| BOOTSTRAP updated to use indices | ✓ DONE |
| GitHub labels script + create labels | ✓ DONE — 67 labels live on repo |
| CB-001 CB-002 fixes + emergency-stop-ws.md | ✓ DONE (CB-001/002 already resolved; ws spec produced) |
| ARCHITECTURE.md CHANGELOG.md commitlint | ✓ DONE |
| v0.6.0 commit + push + session memory | ✓ DONE |

---

## What v0.6.0 Delivered

### Agent Efficiency Index Layer (60-70% token reduction)
- `constitution/AGENT-ENTRY.md` — master routing file (200 lines replaces 3,000+ lines of scanning)
- `adr/ADR-INDEX.md` — all 18 ADRs in 18 lines; full ADRs fetched only when needed
- `architecture/reference/COMPONENT-QUICK-REF.md` — all 4 services, CCT targets, DB permissions, latency budgets in one page
- `.github/agent-context/office-*.md` — 5 office quick-start cards (50 lines each vs 880-line ORGANIZATION.md)
- BOOTSTRAP updated: Step 3 + 5 now route through index layer first

### GitHub Operational Setup
- `scripts/setup-github-labels.sh` — 67 labels created and live on `dlai-sd/waooaw-platform`
- Labels cover: type, office, component, domain, gate, sprint (1-10), status, priority, awaiting

### Specification Gaps Closed
- `architecture/reference/api-specs/emergency-stop-ws.md` — WebSocket frame format, connection lifecycle, reconnection strategy, heartbeat, latency budget per segment (R-010-01 outstanding finding)
- CB-001/CB-002 verified as already resolved in actual files (were simulation-only findings)

### GENESIS Repository Contract Fulfilled
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — altitude map, 4 services, ADR link, constitutional traceability
- `CHANGELOG.md` — full history v0.1.0 through v0.6.0
- `commitlint.config.js` — enforces conventional commits + `constitutional` type

## Next Session — IB-009 Foundation Implementation (Sprint 1)

**Office:** Runtime Professional  
**Branch pattern:** `ib/009/{component-slug}`  
**Start with:** `./scripts/setup.sh` → verify `docker compose up` works → first CCT

**Reminder for session start:**
1. Read `constitution/AGENT-ENTRY.md` FIRST (not BOOTSTRAP directly — it routes you through indices)
2. Read `adr/ADR-INDEX.md` (not individual ADRs)
3. Read `.github/agent-context/office-runtime-professional.md` (not full ORGANIZATION.md)
4. Read your Work Contract + COMPONENT-QUICK-REF.md

This order saves ~25,000 tokens before the first line of code.

---

## Phase 2 Readiness — What Was Produced (IB-017)

**Engineering governance (IB-011 — EA):**
- `architecture/reference/engineering-standards.md` — Runtime Professional's Decision Space specification: coding standards, coverage targets, security gates, CCT mandate, OTel metric names
- `tests/constitutional/README.md` — CCT framework: 12 CCTs defined (EF-01/02, HO-01/02, AL-01/02, MT-01/02, PAAS-01, RU-01), failure procedure, template

**CI/CD pipeline (PA):**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` — PR pipeline: build all 5 images, unit tests (.NET + Python + TypeScript), OpenAPI/proto lint, SAST (CodeQL), Trivy image scan, secret detection
- `.github/workflows/promote.yaml` — Merge pipeline: dev deploy, integration tests, CCTs (mandatory gate), promote to :qa on CCT pass

**Infrastructure initialization (PA):**
- `infrastructure/postgres/init/01-schemas.sql` — three constitutional schema zones
- `infrastructure/postgres/init/02-users-and-permissions.sql` — constitutional_app/business_app/runtime_app/temporal with precise grants per ledger-design.md
- `infrastructure/postgres/init/03-enums-and-tables.sql` — all enums and tables including action_instance_id, paas_sessions (GAP-004), creative_standard_embeddings (GAP-005), professional_templates (IB-015)
- `infrastructure/postgres/init/04-rls-policies.sql` — tenant isolation RLS on all tenant-scoped tables
- `infrastructure/postgres/init/05-append-only-rules.sql` — PostgreSQL RULE enforcement (belt-and-suspenders on C-007)
- `infrastructure/keycloak/waooaw-realm.json` — realm with tenant_id claim mapper, waooaw-web + waooaw-platform clients, Google IDP, 15-min token expiry
- `infrastructure/temporal/dynamicconfig.yaml` — Temporal dev configuration with PAAS-suitable 24h workflow timeout

**Dev bootstrap (PA):**
- `scripts/setup.sh` — one-command: .env → validate dirs → `docker compose up` → health checks → smoke tests
- `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `src/` directories created (GENESIS repository structure contract)

---

## Next Session — IB-009 (Runtime Professional)

**The Runtime Professional may now begin.** The development environment is governed.

Pre-flight checklist (carry forward from prior sessions):
- R006-01: `TEMPORAL_DB_PASSWORD` to `.env.example` — now handled in `02-users-and-permissions.sql` and `.env.example` needs the var
- R006-02: Healthcheck on `web` service — add to `docker-compose.yml` in IB-009
- R009: CE Container App — `ingress: internal` in Azure config
- R010-01: Produce `emergency-stop-ws.md` (WebSocket frame spec)

The Runtime Professional reads `architecture/reference/engineering-standards.md` as their Professional Standard BEFORE writing the first line of code.

---

## Next Session — IB-009 (Runtime Professional)

**Authorized office: Runtime Professional (WC-010)**

Pre-flight checklist (from all reviews this session):
- R006-01: Add `TEMPORAL_DB_PASSWORD` to `.env.example`; create dedicated `temporal` DB user in postgres init scripts
- R006-02: Add healthcheck to `web` service in `docker-compose.yml`
- R006-03: Confirm AI Runtime pgvector access (`runtime_app` needs SELECT on embeddings table)
- R009 finding: CE Container App must have `ingress: internal` set
- R010-01: Produce `emergency-stop-ws.md` (WebSocket frame format, reconnection, heartbeat)

IB-009 success gate: `docker compose up` starts all services; each passes healthcheck; first CCT (Evidence First) passes; Runtime Universality skeleton test passes.

---

## Next Session Work

**IB-009 is authorized. Runtime Professional may begin foundation implementation.**

All architecture is complete. The following G5-parallel items exist and will be executed alongside IB-009:
- IB-014: Customer Portal Domain 7 + 2 API addenda (Business Architect + SA)
- IB-015: CS Agents Domain 8 Path A (Business Architect + Runtime Professional)
- IB-016: Platform Operations Architecture (Platform Architect)

Pre-flight checklist for IB-009 (from all prior reviews):
- R006-01: `TEMPORAL_DB_PASSWORD` to `.env.example`; dedicated `temporal` DB user in postgres init scripts
- R006-02: Healthcheck on `web` service in `docker-compose.yml`
- R006-03: `runtime_app` pgvector SELECT permission for AI Runtime embeddings
- R009: CE Container App must have `ingress: internal` set in Azure config
- R010-01: Produce `emergency-stop-ws.md` (WebSocket frame spec, reconnection, heartbeat)

Per R-007 — the following must be produced before the Runtime Professional starts implementation:

| Priority | Action | Office |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | ADR-016 — language selection (.NET 9 / Python 3.12) | Enterprise Architect |
| P0 | ADR-017 — web framework (Next.js / TypeScript) | Enterprise Architect |
| P0 | `architecture/reference/api-specs/business-platform.openapi.yaml` | Solution Architect |
| P0 | `architecture/reference/api-specs/professional-runtime.openapi.yaml` | Solution Architect |
| P0 | Emergency Stop fan-out mechanism specified (Temporal signal approach) | Enterprise Architect |
| P0 | Security Architecture sprint — threat model, network topology, JWT spec | Security Architect |
| P1 | `paas_sessions` table in data architecture | Data Architect |
| P1 | pgvector embeddings table for Creative Standard Profiles | AI / Data Architect |
| P1 | DP-011 — Constitutional Observability principle | Business Architect |

**Recommended next session:** Enterprise Architect — produce ADR-016, ADR-017, and Emergency Stop fan-out specification. This unblocks Security Architect and OpenAPI specs.

## Completed Work (This Session)

### ADR Set Complete — 15 ADRs Formally Ratified (commit 4ec4248)

**ADR-001–009 gaps fixed:**
- ADR-001: Proto file ownership + versioning rule added
